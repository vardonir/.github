I'm Vardonir.

I do stuff. A bunch of stuff, the nature of which varies depending on the time of the year.

My current main project is something called Project SI-X - an attempt to re-create environments from a certain video game.

I have several sub-projects as well, but none are in a stage that can be public just yet.

You can find me on most major social media websites, but if you want a chance of me seeing your message, send me a DM (not chat!) on reddit.
